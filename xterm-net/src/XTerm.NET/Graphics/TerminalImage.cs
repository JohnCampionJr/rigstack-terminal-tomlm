/// one bitmap per cell. The cells still own their piece of it -- each carries the tile coordinates
/// it displays -- so overwriting a single cell removes exactly that cell's worth of picture, which
/// is the behaviour that makes an image act like terminal content instead of an overlay. What the
/// sharing buys is one allocation per image rather than columns times rows of them, and a host
/// that can recognise a run of adjacent tiles and blit them in a single call.</para>
/// <para>Immutable, so it can be handed to a renderer on another thread without copying, and so a
/// host can cache a texture against it for as long as it lives. It dies when the last cell holding
/// it is overwritten or scrolled out of the buffer -- there is no eviction list to keep in step.</para>
/// <para>Deliberately framework-neutral: raw bytes and integers, no bitmap type. XTerm.NET has no
