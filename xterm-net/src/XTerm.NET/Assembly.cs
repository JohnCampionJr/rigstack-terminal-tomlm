// The graphics decoders are the exception. PngDecoder is a pure byte-array-in, pixels-out function
// with five scanline filters, five colour types and a dozen ways to be malformed, and reaching it
// through an escape sequence would test the escape sequence -- a wrong pixel would surface as a
// picture that looked odd, with nothing to say which filter or which channel was at fault.
